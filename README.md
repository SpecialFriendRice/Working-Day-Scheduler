# Working-Day-Scheduler
Calendar app for scheduling diary events in a working day, built as part of Module 7 challenge

# Module 7 challenge

Using starter code, the challenge was to create and deploy a simple app presenting users with a diary-format single page for the current day, consisting of rows for each hour of the working day into which text can be entered as if for appointments/reminders. The background colour of each row needed to dynamically update dependent on whether the relevant hour is in the past, present or future compared to the current time. A button was needed to save text entries to local storage, with code allowing these text entries to persist on page refresh.
